						<b>Welcome to the 2011-12 skating season!</b><br />
						The exhilaration, fun and beauty of skating can be shared by all, even those who have never skated before. The Yale Figure Skating Club (YFSC) welcomes adults and children of all skill levels. Basic Skills classes are appropriate for recreational and hockey skaters who want to improve skating skills. If you are a more experienced figure skater, come to one of our MFD sessions where you can practice Moves in the field, Freestyle and Dance. For intermediate skaters we are offering a bridge program as well as group dance lessons.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Join us</strong><br />
						You may join the Yale Figure Skating Club and skate at our sessions by filling out the registration forms and paying the required session fees and dues. See the section on <a href="#CM">membership</a> for information on how to enroll and for information about club and national dues</a>. Dues cover membership for the entire year. Session fees are charged by term and are listed with the information about each session.

							<b>Qualifications:</b> Skater must be able to stand on two skates, unaided. Must be at least five years old or have passed <i>Snowplow Sam</i> level 2.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our Basic Skills sessions offer lessons for skaters from school age through adult. Children and youth progress through the <b>Basic Eights</b> curriculum; for adults there are four levels. Details are contained in the Basic Skills Record Book that skaters receive when they join a session, and also on the <a href="<%= Url.Content("/Content/files/attach/basic_eights_program.pdf") %>">Basic 8's</a> pdf file.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each session includes a group lesson, and all include practice time. During the lessons, skaters are divided into groups depending on their age and skill level. All groups are kept small enough so that each skater receives personal attention from the coach. Lessons focus on learning how to move, stop, turn, skate gracefully, and feel confident on the ice. Our goals are for skaters to have fun while they learn, and to enjoy the challenge of the sport and the company of other club members. Many skaters take private lessons during the practice time.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Please note: There are no makeup sessions to compensate for absences. Saturday and Sunday sessions are not interchangeable.</i>

							<b>Qualifications</b>: For beginners, ages 3&ndash;5. Many preschool children are determined to skate, especially when they see older family members taking lessons. The U.S. Figure Skating <i>Snowplow Sam Curriculum</i> is based on the special needs of preschoolers. Stories, games, and circle exercises are used to teach basic coordination and skills. All Snowplow Sam skaters must wear helmets. See the section on <a href="#CL">clothing and equipment</a>.<br />
							<br />
							On Saturday, each child must be accompanied by a parent (who must also join YFSC and USFSA). Lessons are designed to teach the children and also to teach the parent how to help the child learn. Teacher, parents, and children stay at one end of the ice for the whole hour. <br />
							<br />
							On Sunday, children must be at least 4 years old. They attend the lessons without a parent and must stay in the designated area at all times. <br />

							<li>Ice Dance consists of a number of set patterns of graded difficulty, each of which has a particular rhythm (e.g., waltz, foxtrot, tango) and a set sequence of steps. Dances may be skated solo or with a partner. Skaters may earn Dance badges in the USFS Basic Skills program.</li>
							<li>Synchronized Skating is a team sport in which 8--20 skaters perform a choreographed program to music. Skaters perform skating steps in unision and create a series of formations. Skaters may earn Synchronized Team badges in the USFS Basic Skills program.<br />

							Enrollments for the MFD sessions are kept small so that the rink is a safe place for faster skating, jumps, dance footwork, and various moves. All skaters on MFD-1 are expected to be especially cautious; double jumps and fast-moving, high level skating are not appropriate on that session.
						</p>
						<p>
							Skaters may arrange for private or small group instruction during these sessions. Skaters may request that their music be played according to rules set by the session chair. (The designated skater must wear a brightly colored vest.) &nbsp; In addition, social dance program music will be played at the MFD-3 session.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Qualifications</b>: Skaters on the MFD sessions should be able to skate forward and backward with confidence, be comfortable turning front-to-back and back-to-front, and have mastered stopping. They should be experienced enough to feel secure near others who are skating fast and to keep a safe distance from them. The YFSC reserves the right to determine if a skater's abilities are appropriate to the session, regardless of test level.

						<br />
						<ul>
							<li><b>Basic Skills Badge Tests.</b><br />
							The U.S. Figure Skating Basic Skills badge tests are conducted continuously throughout the season during the regular sessions, with badges awarded upon completion of each test. Tests are always low key; the professionals recommend a test when a skater seems ready. Often, parents and children start lessons together and progress together through the badges.<br />
							<br />

						Skaters may arrange for private lessons with approved coaches during the club session and the MFD sessions. Fees vary but are approximately $15 for a 15-minute individual lesson, or around $30 for a half hour. You may speak with the session chair or member of the Coach Committee for help in arranging lessons or for advice on selecting a coach. (The Coach Committee maintains information on the qualifications of all approved coaches. This information is kept at the rink and is available to any member or parent who is seeking a coach.) If you would like to contact one of the coaches to arrange for private lessons, please call our voice mail number (203) 432-1233 and leave a message.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most beginners progress rapidly during the group lessons provided in the Basic Skills sessions. Sometimes, however, a skater may get stuck on a particular skill and would profit from individual lessons. The coaches who teach our group lessons are available for private lessons during Basic Skills practice time and are willing to arrange either regular lessons or a few "ad hoc" lessons. Lessons at this level are typically 15 or 20 minutes. The lesson does not need to be with the assigned group coach.
					</p>
					<p>
						Advanced skaters usually take private lessons. 15&ndash;minute to one hour lessons are arranged in advance with any of our approved coaches. Guest coaches are welcome to teach session subscribers, but must be registered with the Club. (Contact the Coach Committee Chair for information.)<br />

Fees for each term are payable in full before the beginning of that term. USFS membership fees are paid on an annual basis and are payable before the first term skated.

						<strong>Equipment and Clothing</strong><br />
						Required equipment includes a good-fitting pair of skates and warm clothing, including gloves. Figure skates are recommended, but hockey skates can also be used at the beginning levels. <b>A protective helmet is required for Snowplow Sam, Basic 1 and 2, and Adult 1.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Clothing</b> should be warm and non-restrictive, including pants, a warm sweater, one pair of thin socks, and knitted mittens or gloves. Girls who are more advanced often like to wear tights and a short skating dress. Local sources for skating apparel:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Skater's Landing, 84 Washington Ave., North Haven (203-234-3923), <a href="http://www.skaterslanding.com">www.skaterslanding.com</a>.</li>
						<li>Dancer's World, 2348 Whitney Ave., Hamden (203-248-9304).</li>
						<li>The Dancer's Boutique, 224 Main Street, East Haven (203-469-6637).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Helmets.</b> Look for a skating helmet that covers the back and sides of the head, as well as the forehead and top. Hockey, skateboarding, inline skating, or ski helmets may be a better choice than bicycle helmets, especially for older children and adults.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Accessories.</b> We recommend a skate bag to carry and protect the skates. Some useful items to put in it are a clean rag, cloth blade covers, skate guards, and spare gloves. Use skate guards whenever you walk around off the ice. The rubber mats do not adequately protect the blades, and there are no mats leading to the restrooms upstairs. When you take your skates off, remove the guards and carefully dry the blades. Do not put the guards back on since they cause the blades to rust. The best way to protect your blades while they are in your bag is to use cloth blade covers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sharpening.</b> All blades become dull after prolonged use and need periodic sharpening. Special equipment and expertise are required to sharpen figure skate blades properly. Recommended vendors are: Chris Bartlett at Skater's Landing, 84 Washington Ave., North Haven (203--234--3923); George Knakal, Norwalk, CT (203-857-4670); and Michael Sklutovsky, Skate Escape LLC, Middlefield, CT (860-983-5044). Be sure to call ahead&mdash;appointments may be necessary.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Buying Figure Skates.</b> Very good equipment is important. It is better to buy good used skates which fit well than a new pair to ``grow into'' from catalogs or discount store skates. Some reliable brands are Don Jackson, Harlick, Klingbeil, Riedell, and SP Teri for boots and Wilson and MK for blades, but avoid ``bottom line'' skates. Suitable skates have leather uppers and soles, not vinyl or plastic, and the blades are attached with screws, not rivets. Beware of lower quality skates sold by mass merchandisers and some low-end sport shops.
					</p>
					<p>
						A good fit is vital. Figure skates often run one-half to one full size smaller than street shoes. A skating boot should fit close to the foot without pinching the toes and should grip the heel so that it does not slip up and down in the back of the boot. Wear tights or very lightweight socks when being fitted (and when skating). The boot <b>must</b> support the ankle properly so that standing up over the blade comes naturally. A boot that is too big or too flimsy cannot do this and permits the ankle to drop over, making skating difficult and painful.
					</p>
					<p>
						Choosing appropriate skates and fitting them takes some expertise. Club members have had good experience in the past with the skate dealers listed below:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Chris Bartlett at Skater's Landing (see above) carries Don Jackson, Klingbeil and Riedell Skates and accessories.</li>
						<li>Ferguson's Ice Pro Shop, 307 Race Brook Road, Orange, CT 06477 (203-799-7200).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Buying Skates for Children and Snowplow Sam</b> Good skates for this level are essential for growing feet. The Don Jackson brand comes in sizes small enough to fit tots. One model is the Glacier Youth Series. It is leather, has a pvc sole that allows the blade to be moved, if needed, is padded and lined. For a few dollars more, the Soft Skate model for girls has just been introduced. It has the same features at the Glacier, with an interior plush fleece for comfort. It is also available in larger sizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						An option for ages 4--5 (only) is the molded skate which is carried by LL Bean and JC Penney (Little Princess and Little Prince). Unlike other skates, they correspond to shoe size. One coach tells us they provide support and have a flatter blade for good balance. While we do not endorse these products (and we recommend that skates always be fitted by a knowledgeable person familiar with skating equipment), availability can be a problem and this may be a solution, but only after exhausting your search with local suppliers. Please note: Molded skates are <b>not</b> recommended for skaters beyond age 5. Molded skates lack flexibility and could cause injuries to older skaters who have more body weight to support. Double runners are never permitted.<br />

						<strong>Ice Rules and Safety</strong><br />
						The session chair has the responsibility and authority to enforce all rules and may ask a skater to leave the ice or withdraw from the session. Safety and courtesy are of utmost importance. Each skater must respect the right of others to make effective use of their ice time.
